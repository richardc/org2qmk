#+title: org2qmk_keymap

ergodone/ergodox-ez layout

* Idea
As I was starting to hacking on a qmk keymap for an ergodone, anticipating that I'd
later have to port it for the ergodox-ez, keymap.c to lay it out, it
occured to me that I could use org-mode's table mode, and then
translate it to C.

The only special syntax should be the =mode= header.  The table is
translated left to right, top to bottom into an array, so the use of
=""= as a way of generating a =KC_TRANS= token is imprtant to
translate the structure correctly.  This should hopefully still be few
steps than planning the keys, then counting symbols into the keymap.


* Usage

bundle exec org2keymap --in ./examples/ergodone_default.org --out keymap.c

* Examples
The default ergodone layout [[./examples/ergodone_default.org]]

A blank ergodone mode [[./examples/ergodone_blank.org]]
